## Description

This app is something I've been wanting to create for a long time and it's manifestation is the culmination of everything I've learned about software development so far.

So much of self-love is dependent on self-awareness and the overall goal of this app is to grow self-love by increasing self-awareness.

The general idea is to have a place where you can be prompted to answer and write about meaningful questions that will allow you to gain a deeper understanding of yourself.

The app is still in the early stages of development but over time it will evolve into a fully featured social self-discovery app.
